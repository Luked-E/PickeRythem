 A small game made for the Raspberry Pi Pico using CircuitPython, a MicroPython derivative.

# Code Base:

Inputs are checked with a range function that resets half way through a successful range. So the Check input function("Timer3()" method) allows for scoring in half of the acceptable input range at the beginning and that range at the start.
